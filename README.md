Learning:-

1. I  learned how to plan a project and execute that.
2. i learnt how to connect front end backend.
3. We learnt how to implement dynamic routing in a project.
4. We learned some external libraries that reduce the code and provide flexibility.

Overall our experience is great to work with one another.
